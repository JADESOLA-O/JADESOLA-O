## üèÜ Featured Projects
# Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition System
Description:The primary aim of the study is to identified the best-performing CNN model among VGG16, ResNet50, baseline and EfficientNetB3 for real-time facial emotion recognition and integrate the model with the best performance into a streamlit web application that can detect emotions accurately and efficiently. The secondary goals are to design a system that excels in training unseen and real-world data, guaranteeing its practical usefulness and constructing an efficient system that can be directly employed in real-time applications. The study created a practical FER system for deployment in diverse applications by exploring and combining advanced CNN architectures with data augmentation and real-time processing techniques.
Features: Detects five basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral) in real-time.
Key Technologies: Python, Pytorch, Tensorflow, keras, CNN, Haar Cascade, Colab.
Result: ResNet50 was the top-performing model due to its consistent and balanced learning across training and validation, showing minimal overfitting and smooth loss convergence. VGG16 ranks second, as it performs reasonably well but shows signs of overfitting, with more fluctuation in validation performance. The baseline model takes the third spot, mainly due to its instability during training and validation, as evidenced by fluctuating accuracy and loss curves. EfficientNetB3 ranks last, as it overfits the training data significantly, with no indication of how well it performs on validation data, and poor performance on unseen data.

# Car Price Prediction
Description: Developed a machine learning model to predict car prices based on key features.
For model building, we constructed a regression model to predict car prices, utilizing various machine learning algorithms. Four algorithms were selected: eXtreme Gradient Boosting Regression, Voting Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Linear Regression. Using the ‚Äòtrain_test_split‚Äô function from scikit-learn, we pre-processed the data by dividing it into training and testing sets in a 70:30 ratio before implementation in the model-building process. To select the most effective features, we employed feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods such as SelectKBest and PCA. 
Algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Trees, Ensemble.
Result: The Random Forest model, with an R2 value of 0.8553 shows a good fit, explaining approximately 86% of the variance in the target variable. Moreover, an RMSE value of 2160.37 suggests that, on average, the model predicts car prices with an error of about 2,160.
In the case of XGBR, the relatively low RMSE and high R¬≤ again suggest robust predictive performance on the test set, with an R2 value of 0.8738 indicating a strong correlation between the model predictions and the data. This value explains about 88% of the variance in the target variable.Furthermore, the RMSE value of approximately 2017.43.The Ensemble exhibited the lowest root mean squared error with a mean RMSE of 1991.68 and a standard deviation of 37.92, indicating it has the best predictive accuracy among the models tested for this particular dataset and feature set (X_train_kbest).
